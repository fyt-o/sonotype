# Sonotype

An exploration towards using the way we speak to create type forms that are generative towards a universal, inclusive and expressive communication.

### Introduction

Chances are that we learnt to communicate with each other using our bodies before we began to communicate using abstract representations, shapes and pictures. Text is probably a method by which we could standardise certain aspects of our communication. How much of our communication through the medium of sound and body is still captured in our textual communications? Why has letterform been created in different languages in the way it has? What could inform our typeforms for more comprehensibility, legibility and expression?
